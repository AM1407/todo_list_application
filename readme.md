# 📝 Simple To-Do List App

A clean, simple, and persistent to-do list application built with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. This project allows users to add, manage, and delete tasks. All tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so your to-dos will be waiting for you when you return.

## ✨ Features

* **Add Tasks:** Easily add new to-do items to your list.
* **Add with Enter:** Press the `Enter` key in the input field to quickly add a task.
* **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so they don't disappear when you refresh the page or close the browser.
* **Delete Single Task:** Remove items one by one with a delete button (`×`) on each task.
* **Clear All:** A "Clear All Todos" button to wipe the entire list at once.
* **Empty State:** Displays a friendly message when there are no tasks left.
* **Responsive UI:** Built with Bootstrap for a clean and functional look on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
